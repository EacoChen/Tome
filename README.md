# Optimal-growth-temperture-predictor
A machine learning model for the prediction of optimal growth temperature of microorganisms<br/>
This method has two submodules: (1) model for the prediction of optimal growth temperature; (2) blast a given seqeuence against the sequences with the same EC nubmer.
