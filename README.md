# Optimal-growth-temperture-predictor
A machine learning model for the prediction of optimal growth temperature of microorganisms<br/>
This method has two submodules: (1) model for the prediction of optimal growth temperature; (2) find the homologues for a given seqeuence with the same EC nubmer. 

## 1. Prediction of optimal growth temperature

## 2. Get homologues for a given enzyme sequence.
